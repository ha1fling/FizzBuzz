# FizzBuzz
## Coding challenge
FizzBuzz is a common coding task used to test computational thinking and coding ability. I'm choosing to write these for fun as I havn't used some of these languages in over a year! 

This repo will contain FizzBuzz code using the following languages:

- [X] Python 
- [X] GoLang 
- [X] Ruby
- [X] Java
- [X] C# 
- [X] PHP 
- [ ] JS

### The task:

"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”
